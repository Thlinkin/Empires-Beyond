# An Experiment
An AI experiment done in one day. With guidance, an attempt to make a entropic civilization simulator using only AI. I have done none of the code in this project, only guided the AI on what to do. The model used was ChatGPT 5.2 and I framed this project as a limit test for current AI models. Needless to say, this is very impressive and though provoking.

# ZoteBoat: Empires Beyond (CLI Edition)

Welcome to **ZoteBoat: Empires Beyond**, a turn-based grand strategy simulation powered by a custom scripting language: **ZoteScript**.

You are not a faction leader — you are **The Boat-That-Decides**, an external force that can influence factions through policies, treaties, research, trade, war, and eventually space logistics.
